# Contributing to Mozilla

Thanks to Mozilla, our partner for this Hacktoberfest event! ðŸ¦Š

### Set Up

One of the Mozilla repos that we'll be working on is Bedrock. Here's some instructions on set up:

Bedrock:
- https://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- https://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Before diving into code it might be worth reading through the Developing on Bedrock documentation, which contains useful information and links to our coding guidelines for Python, Django, JavaScript and CSS.

Protocol:
- https://protocol.mozilla.org/docs/index.html

Coding style can be really personal and everyone has their own opinions and preferences. But when we work as a team on a shared codebase it's invaluable to agree to some basic rules. The CSS in Protocol should be written consistently no matter who wrote it.
